## Why Customizing TreeView in WPF is Necessary

In WPF, TreeView and TreeViewItem provide default templates like other standard controls. However, TreeView offers diverse ways of representation and a free hierarchical layout without constraints, making the default templates somewhat limited. Therefore, it is crucial to thoroughly understand and utilize the mechanisms and characteristics of this TreeView control, which inherits from ItemsControl.

## TreeView Mechanism: Different from ListBox but Both Inherit ItemsControl

ListBox, one of the typical controls inheriting from ItemsControl, has a clear hierarchical mechanism between parent and child. Thus, while ListBox inherits from ItemsControl, ListBoxItem inherits from ContentControl, making the hierarchical structure intuitive to understand from the inheritance structure alone.

However, in the case of TreeView and TreeViewItem, the top-level parent is TreeView, but the child TreeViewItem can also contain its own children, acting as both parent and child. Hence, ironically, TreeViewItem also inherits from ItemsControl. This is a fundamental concept of the TreeView control.

## Understanding TreeView's Identity through ItemsSource Property and ItemsPresenter Element

As mentioned earlier, both TreeView and TreeViewItem inherit from ItemsControl, thus both controls have the ItemsSource collection property. Therefore, it is essential to specify the area for the ItemsPresenter element within the template for the parent control. Similarly, for recursive structures, the child control must also create a binding for the ItemsSource property and an area for the ItemsPresenter element.

The summarized source code is as follows:

_TreeView Template_
```xaml
<Style TargetType="{x:Type TreeView}">
    <Setter Property="ItemsSource" Value="{Binding Files}"/>
    <Setter Property="Template">
        <Setter.Value>
            <ControlTemplate>
                <ItemsPresenter/>
            </ControlTemplate>
        </Setter.Value>
    </Setter>
</Style>
```

_TreeViewItem Template_
```xaml
<Style TargetType="{x:Type TreeViewItem}">
    <Setter Property="ItemsSource" Value="{Binding Children}"/>
    <Setter Property="Template">
        <Setter.Value>
            <ControlTemplate>
                <StackPanel>
                    <TextBlock Text="{Binding Name}"/>
                    <ItemsPresenter/>
                </StackPanel>
            </ControlTemplate>
        </Setter.Value>
    </Setter>
</Style>
```
